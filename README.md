<h1>ToDoWoo for tasks.</h1>
The “to do woo” program is designed to create a list of tasks. The program helps to manage to-do lists, implement planned tasks and not forget anything.
The user has the ability to create a list of tasks, in the process of their execution, can change, delete, complete.
The program is implemented in the Python programming language using:

- Django;
- Redis;
- HTML;
- CSS;

Description of the program interface:
When the “New todo” button is clicked, the createtodo event handler invokes a modal window to create a task.
The window contains fields for title, description, priority selection, saving and returning to the main menu.
There is a limit on the number of characters on the field for entering the name, if the number of characters entered matches the maximum number,
are checked using the max_length attribute. In the modal window, the user has a warning label for the maximum number of input characters.
The project was implemented using caching, in my case "Redis", also for convenience, the tool "Django-Toolbar" was used, object-oriented programming,
framework Django, HTML, CSS, Python, SqLite(default), TestCase. 

1. - Modal window for creating a task.
The “Save” button, if all fields are filled, calls the createtodo () function in which the markup of the task is generated with all the entered values and
by choosing to change the state of the task.
